This repository contains a library of functions to print text in different colors in a Ubuntu Terminal. It requires at least Lua 5.2.

Here's what it can do:

To run the examples, run this command:
````
lua5.2 examples/<file>.lua
````
It won't work if you run these commands:
````
cd examples
lua5.2 <file>.lua
````
